  REFERENCE REQUEST - Regular Email Order vs Instant Email Order
  
  This request demonstrates the REGULAR email order structure for comparison.
  DO NOT use this for the demo - it's just for understanding the differences!
  
  KEY DIFFERENCES between Regular Orders and Instant Orders:
  
  REGULAR EMAIL ORDER (this request):
  - Endpoint: POST /notifications/api/v1/future/orders
  - Structure: { recipient: { recipientEmail: { ... } } }
  - Has "sendingTimePolicy" field
  - Part of a larger order system with scheduling
  
  INSTANT EMAIL ORDER (see instant-email.bru):
  - Endpoint: POST /notifications/api/v1/future/orders/instant/email
  - Structure: { recipientEmail: { ... } }
  - NO "sendingTimePolicy" (always sent immediately)
  - Direct single-recipient immediate sending
  - Missing "senderEmailAddress" in regular vs required in instant
  
  The instant API is simpler and focused on immediate delivery to a single recipient,
  while the regular API supports complex scheduling and multiple recipients.
