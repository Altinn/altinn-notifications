  Idempotency Demo

  This folder demonstrates how idempotency works with instant notifications.

  The idempotencyId ensures that if the same request is sent multiple times,
  only the first one will be processed, and subsequent requests will return
  the original response with a 200 status code instead of 201.

  Usage:
  1. Run the "1st" request first - should return 201 Created
  2. Run the "2nd" request (same idempotencyId) - should return 200 OK with same response

  Note: The idempotencyId is fixed in these requests for demonstration purposes,
  unlike the main requests which use random UUIDs.
